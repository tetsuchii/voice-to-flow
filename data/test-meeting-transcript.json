  "transcript": " Let's do All right, so I think I should thank acknowledges for all of you. Thank you. I'm a member of the EI. The EI. Yes, these are the members of the EI. You're doing well. The EI is a member of the EI, as well as the members of the EI. The best thing we will do is to keep our members of the EI. So... You're going to be great. Yes. You can go to the LL, because you don't know that from Hungary. Yes, so... I'm not a fan of you, but I'm a fan of you. So... The best, the best, the best, the best, the best. What can you say? I don't know what to say. I just entered the contest. There are many of them. I think it's time to say goodbye. I hope everyone will return to the real EI. The next EI is coming. I already feel the EI spirit. I'm already excited. Me too. Well, I think we will be so happy. So, we thought that we would prepare all kinds of exciting things. And we would be happy to have you as part of the qualifier. The quantity was lost. We have a few weeks left. We have a few weeks left. We started to watch the event. I will show you everything that we have. I am curious to see what you have to say. We have not written anything down, but we can talk about it. What we want to communicate with you. Let's take a picture. Let's take a picture. So, tell us what you think. I think so. This is the little fake master file. There are all kinds of things in it. We showed the previous column of things in this. If I get a chance, I will talk to you later. Yes, yes. So, we gathered all of this. And what you can see here, just quickly, without any delay, there is a digitalized part. Let's go here. We will show you. There is a qualitative analysis. There is a quantitative analysis. We just started. We will show you a little bit of the qualitative analysis. There were three groups. There were six teams the next day. The first group was the Apple Pay users who are digitally finished. The second group was the Apple Pay users who are not digitally finished. The third group was the Apple Pay users who are not digitally finished. So, each group was a qualitative group. And each of them had the same results as we went. There was an empathy field that was basically the user-polluted tests that we did before. We had different applications. We had a sense of value, where we had to have different motivators. We had to be able to understand how important it is to be able to understand what kind of proposition we could have based on the bank numbers. And the last group was a dystopian and utopian and we had to have a very positive and positive attitude towards the functions and the functions that we would like to have. And as I said before, we had a usability test. We also had a little bit of a learning experience. And you guys have already mentioned it. We will start a little bit by starting with you. The first group is very important. What were you like? How did you feel about it? Do you want to show us the next group? Next? I don't know, I will read it out. Of course, I will. I can see that you are making mistakes. But actually, there were so many mistakes in the big ones. What I think is very useful is that users can also do things that are worth doing and what they are too much for them. And at least for a few hours I was able to record what I said during the test and what happened later. I was able to think about what happened later on, whether it was important or not. I was able to think about the future and what we are going to be like. But I didn't see a lot of mistakes in the 6 people I met. But I didn't want to repeat it. I saw that they could do things like this. This was the biggest mistake. In terms of the finitions, we have calculated that the first two groups were more finish. They were more or less full-man. But the third day, we were able to calculate the finitions and we wanted to calculate the NFC, why they didn't ask for a code, and the basic rules that they didn't have. There were a lot of these, but obviously there were a lot of them. But one thing was interesting. I forgot. Thank you. Yes, we took them to these groups. I don't think I'm going to go alone. I'd rather not show the whole board that we made. We basically made a group of people and we did a little bit of this. We did a little bit of this because we had such a basic attitude and the finitions. And we also made friends who were motivated to understand how they were getting these. We also found the pyramids. But we did this in a very tight form. When we were in the lowest level, we were the ones who were actually in the middle. Because it only came back, and I'll tell you later, I'm going to the same place in the first place. It only came back that what wasn't so important wasn't important because they didn't keep the function of the genital, but because it was completely unbearable and completely unbearable. For example, there are many banks and the banks have applications, functions, and extra services. Because the starting point is the people in the middle. Many times they thought more or more revolutionary examples were not so specific. They thought only in the first place. So there were more associations. And there were points that could be used in the next steps. But then we ended up like this. I'll tell you later that we can use these to understand how banks have these applications. We could also use a common order. It's okay if you're asking if you have any comments or anything. If I'm asking, I'll tell you later. I'll tell you later. Thank you. It's interesting that people don't think of such basic things. They don't want to keep it in their hands or in their flow. It's okay because it's always flowing. I'll show you later. So we decided to use this to understand the level of the bank that must be there, because there's no communication. Because people expect from banks that there are things that are not important. That it's fast, it's absolutely. It was important to be sure. It was really important. There are such scales where we developed it. Because it was quite important. Because everyone was important. There may be some criticism. Because it's typical of a kind of property that is not so important. I don't know if I'm right, but it's important to be sure. It's important to be sure. It's a kind of a foundation. How do we communicate with the question what's the extra thing that can be said that it has to be like this. Yes, that's how it should be. I'll give you less and I'll give you more. In any category there are some who use it. It's important that you can use it. What's positive about banks, because at the beginning you don't have to. Or they don't use it first. They try it. And what we've already discussed in the previous video, is the distribution of other cards. It's important to be sure. It's important. It's a great function. It's not a design question. It's a design question. It's important to be sure how it's distributed and how it's distributed. It's not a function but a material motivation. In the Csucson there were software programs and there was a registration bonus. We had to bring it together and tell the quantity to the quantity so that the Csucson had the highest score. We were worried because it wasn't the registration bonus that was the highest. We talked about banks and that it could be positive. We wanted to play with a certain system so that we could use it with the quality. And now I'm going to spoil this to the quantity. We have a separate version. We have a material and a functional version. I showed this before. Let's talk about this. These were the ones that motivated them the most. But this is the basis. We sent everything together. I just want to say that we brought this together. And where it's still available is the motivation of the staff. We brought this together to the team. What was the level of it. I don't know if I'm going to say this but I'm going to say it. Is there something about it? Is it a question or a thought? There is no such thing as a good idea to leave these cards. But the other cards are very important. So it's not a good idea. It's a good idea. But we still think about it. There are two things that can be made easily. The first is that the banks are very busy. We wanted to think about how we can connect the money to the banks. How we can make these things with the help of the money. How we can make such a solution that we can develop with technology. I can't think of a solution to the banks. It's not easy to get it back. But I'm sure it's more important to have a solution. The most important thing is to have a solution. But it's not easy to get it back. But if we can make these things with a different approach. We also want to make a solution. We want to make a solution that we can make it useful. So you have a solution that you can make. You can make a solution with the help of the money on the market. It's not easy to make a solution with technology. It's not easy to make a solution with technology. You can have other options but you can make it useful. You can make it useful. You can make it useful. You can make it useful. You can make it useful. On a young level, I think that as a Telecom tank at the moment, lets say, he or she was the person he was before. There was a person who had been brought on. They used to say that it probably wasn't his mark of 아이 International. That may be a bad habit. On the other hand Nagy, I think that the boom would divided the Netury of Chatbotta crew from their experience. and that this is a key point, so the limited, as a basis. But yes, it was that the human being was the one who could differentiate, because it was important for people. The other attitude was that they would be forced to chat bot or person, making this possible, if they normally could break the age. Now they haven't even been able to communicate. At present these users solutions are quite common. Civil126x tell it to provide a solution that has such a迷 you with no addiction. This can easily be done if we're not particular on this topic. So the reality of the situation, is that there are quite a bit of potential for these solutions while in the chain갑. Now let's try棉thalal majest or would it be possible to do that? It came to me in the year 2004, I don't know if everyone is happy, but there are things in the year 2004, and I'm sure they are. They said it was great, because they tried to buy it from a market, but they didn't give it away. And they were able to call the bank to the S-T, so they could say that it was the time when the Hallow River was being built, and they were able to help them. And then they started to call me, and I had to call them, because if I didn't call them, they would call me, but they were able to call me. So they just said, that's how I feel about it, but that's how it is. Okay. There's more. Anything else? No, no. Thank you very much. And then we'll go into a bit of the nature, and we'll also have to talk about the motivators. The first group was the digital and Finnish users, who use Apple Pay. And here, we have a 39-year-old, a digital user, who can use Apple Pay to integrate things, and also to use the digital finisher, I don't know, to use all kinds of streaming services. And the digital finisher, we believe that digital is the reason that Apple Pay is a user who wants to see everything. You can see it in one piece, and they just want to know that if the real extension of the BuxPay is actually available, the real extension of the BuxPay, the real material, the real connection, and the real experience, they can give, because Apple Pay has a quite good implementation, so we have to apply it to the bank, to develop it. Motivators are also a key point of the BuxPay, and the real experience is absolutely important. The bonus is also here, with the Aqualine, with the Sampont, we have come to this with the registration bonus, for example, we talked about this, but we don't want to do it here, but we want to ask you, what is the bonus that you are telling, what is the value, what are the advantages of the real experience, or I'll say something, most of all, they say that they are holding a 30-40,000-recent bonus, and they say that they have used it for half a year, but we all read that the funds that are being received, which was important, with this service, here, in the development after the next point of view, the test-result, the application program, the application, and the faster payment, the faster payment, the less money is spent on the application, and the number was in the middle, so I was calm, I was just looking at the little ass, I thought so, but I was calm, I was calm, I was calm, I was calm, I was calm, I was calm, I was calm, I was calm, I was calm, I thought that there was an inspection, but no, no, no, this is the point, I don't know, the results are as they were in the first place, but of course you can get money, you can get all the benefits, but you have to be the most important insentives, to be clear. Absolutely, for us, this was the least possible application, but this is a good validation of the hypothesis that we had, and also the will, the will, digitally, I think this is a different kind of writing, everything, this, everything, you have been directly to the audience, I didn't write, I think what do you remember? Because I wrote how the teams came, the teams came like this, after a while, Stimel, the second day was the second day, and I'm sorry, I was nervous. Yes, the first preparation was to use bank card, but digitally, okay, then I was confused. So the will digitally and Apple Pay use it, it is in the 30s and it works in the professional position, in the department, in Budapest and in the regional bank application, and the service and the revolution, he also likes to use his own phone and usually pay more, even online, he also uses it in festivals and in the revolution, in the first part of the program, especially if these are free actions are also released, and what is important is that I use the digital type this is the pleasure, practical solutions, the person who has been given the new solutions but they are very quickly exposed that if this was too complicated or complicated, solutions that are used and they are more simple, easy to use things can be motivated, for example, the security is a little less important or a basic so I say that security is a basic and these extra security functions are important to the previous group, but this is a basic level, but not to motivate them, if we say we talked about this the previous group, if they say even though they have extra codes, after certain times, or in the location, they check where they are safe, and they ask for it, they don't ask for it, but they send something else, in the form of an extra layer, so they send it to them. Maybe I can add that I am a heuristic person, but I don't know why they said that, because they have to connect the security service to the phone and the third party can connect it, but they said that they send one code, if we say 3 times less than 10, they have to send the code, because they don't ask for it, but they were, but they didn't feel that they could connect it, and they can connect it to the background, so they send it to us. But I don't think it's necessary that the solutions are not safe enough, but they can see how much security they get from the whole or how much they are connected to the routine. So it's just that, because the security is important for these kinds of things, they don't want to keep the bank in the phone, because they get out and then they get lost. And then the phone is there, and the money is there, and they also send it to the American Bank, and they feel that it will happen, and even if they are so lucky to have it, they won't have it, and it's not always like that, it's a little interesting thing, but it's worth it. Yes, there are extreme differences in security things. By the way, we can talk about the social and social level how we can say this security question will be the same with the bank, how how we can explain how security is here, and how it's not. And they fear that they will get lost and then they will return with their hands, and they will ask for a face-to-face and how security is there. This is a question we can think about. Thank you. Yes, I have two things to share with you. One is that people don't realize that a person is a woman, and that's a code. This is a good thing, because it's not a single message and it's not just the payment, the ritual is good. One and another, I don't know about it, but the problem is that security needs to be and that the water and the years are being passed on to people and that it's a good and safe way to do it. And maybe we should move on from this because it's a basic and if I don't know how many years we'll be passing on this, how safe this new way of doing it. So I don't know what are the things I want to say about it, but I don't know if we can be more creative and that's why many other aspects have been passed on and people have been more motivated and confident. If you get on the streets and they stop you can't be more confident. I don't know if it's a risk to get on the streets and they stop. Yes, it's good to say that because that's the point. That's all you want to say about the security of people. How many years have you been on a new level and you've been so close to people and you've been on a hygienic level? Super, let's talk about it, and what you said about the speed we asked about the speed and some said that you can't be faster because it's not necessary to be faster. It's It's a security, because the bank has a security, because it's a bank, so it's modern. It's obviously a good company, but they think that the bank has water, because it's a security, so it's a security. And I don't think it's that important, because they think that the other one is the same, so the other one is the same. This is what they always said, that the speed is so interesting that it was a prototype. The face ID is always working, as they said, literally, when they made the payment. This was a very long time ago, and it was very sad to me, that I had to play so hard to not know when the payment was going to be made, and I pressed it to go to the payment, and I pressed it too much, but it seemed like it was paid, and it seemed like it was a very fast technology, and it took the next three hours to figure out how fast this is, and how fast it would be, and I finally said to them that I only pressed it because I thought it was worth it. Yes, yes, yes. By the way, this is just a great combination, that they had such a good-sounding team, that we were sorry that they couldn't make it to the end. At first, they asked me what it was like, and I don't know what they were doing, and they said that it was like a team of developers, and that the second team was already being attacked by people, and they said that they were the developers, and that it was a whole lot. We found out more about this, the first thing, that we were successful, so we were very happy. Yes, there were little things like this, we were also doing a little bit of a speed-up, but at least we know that this is very important, in the sense that they are doing it. But in the sense that speed is the basic and the end is already much faster, so there are more important points. Here, the level of the player type person is absolutely very important. Bonus level is a little less, and the rest is more important than the level of the player type person. But less important than the chest, here was the absolute speed. So there is definitely a very good concept to improve, and the individual activities here too. There are also a lot of extreme info, it is still included in the report, that the individual activities are as they like, so there is enough ammunition here, and it is good to have it. Is there anything else? Questions, comments? No, thank you very much. And then the last one was the digital non-finish bank, not Apple Pay, the user Raiq, with a small problem. It is an older, 45 years old user with a significant sense of representing, less tiny, the two最近 hand sticky phone doesn't cost, who had a positive experience or who were familiar with the usability testing. Benji, for example, said that those who had a good experience, and if they did, they would be super, and they would try everything. So there were positive approaches. It is certain that these people need to be taken care of better, to understand how this is safe, but as Gergő said, the bank has a kind of advantage that the most Hungarian employees can see a very safe and reliable, well-deserved entity in the bank. So it is possible that if they start a type of development, Oh, it's better for automated waiters Yes, cashback, bonus, Freeze운лав for health, which is important and the contract program as a tool for Dr. Náluk, We have a lot of quick-distance and a lot of quick-distance, so that everyone can easily get to the spot. And they don't really like it that much, but the fact that they can easily get to the spot, because they're more comfortable with the shoes, but that they can easily get to the spot, that's too much for them. In a way, everyone was very positive, the group of photographers who did the... Almost, yes. Yes, yes. They did a very nice group of... after the payment, which automatically goes up after the transaction, the successful transaction, and then there are people like, where did the payment go, what was the category, how much was the payment, which everyone really liked. And that's... But again, there are some guys who are making mistakes, but I have to admit that everyone wants to be like this. It was also so much that someone wanted to get a little bit of this, to admit that someone, let's say, it's not important to see how much it was paid, it doesn't want to stress yourself, or it's not important to them, because they pay more for the preparation, so it's not necessarily that much, but this is a function that everyone is very positive about. At least the first part, which category did you do, how much was the monthly payment, until everyone was using it, that's what everyone did. And then, as I said, there are too many people who always see it, but that the basic concept itself has been added to it and is very much liked by them. Yes, yes. There are still some parts of the details that are more specific, we have modified them in the proto, because there are also many fine-tuning and background sounds, but it's still very interesting to go, whether it's any questions or development. I'm very happy that the categories are so liked here. The point is that you can really put the cash back on, I left certain categories, or you can choose the ones you like, and I don't know if I can do that myself. Yes, that's why there are quite a lot of markets, and you can see a kind of contest, but I don't know if you can see it in the background. I love water, and I always get these little things in the months, which are so typical, that I get a lot of money when I'm on Spotify, and I'm so happy, I can do so many things. I don't have a card for you, but if you have one, you can see it. It's good that you can see it, because we get it from you. I think that some cards are not like that. I always have a card for you. You have to choose the best bank, but you don't have it in the MbH, and you don't have it in your pocket. You always get it in the FST, and you always get it in the MbH. Yes, I had it in the MbH, and I didn't have it in the Mastercard, because I had a bank, and I had a bank, and I had a bank, too. So, you always get it in the cashback, and you also had a card for you, so they can also choose which category you want to go to. Yes, yes. So, you also get it in the cashback. Yes, yes, yes. Okay, then, I'll give you a little bit of the utopic, dystopic things. This is actually quite similar to the top, and this is more functional. The users understand that the negative is not stable, the bad user experience, bad UI, it's hard to read, there's no contrast. It's too much, there's a lot of damage, the online work is very important, it's important to be able to pay to get these successful payment and payment to be able to pay, or if it's not a separate fee, it's probably a negative thing, but these are the things you get, so it's very important, what you hear and what we've considered, what's very positive about this, what's connected to the payment, the financial statements we've mentioned, but these are not so different. Security, in this respect, the user experience is much better, it's very simple, it's easy to learn, you can't use it, and I feel that when the payment was successful, they were able to build it from the user experience, the guys, in the prototype, there's a fine version, tell us, what were the changes? We gathered the changes, what are the lessons from these, the first images we saw, and the books, and the lessons we've learned, the whole thing started, this banner, it didn't take any effort, it was a full banner, it's like the user started from the user experience, and it's a basic revenue copy, you can do everything yourself, the lessons here are that you have to put the payment in all the places, the entry point is in the flow, because the additional payments were found with the card, I said before that the book space wouldn't work, they pressed the book space in the middle of the page, so you can do whatever you want, the whole thing starts, and the payment was found in the middle of the page, it was interesting, the page, or not the page, the contactless icon, it's not the user's, they know it, they say it's the Wi-Fi, by the way, I was surprised that this is not used anywhere, this three-page, it's really a color, because it's not really a user's, it's not a familiar icon, for some reason, and they said it many times, I'm sorry, they said it many times that it's not a separate page, if it's not a separate page, they're buying it in their own bank, so it's because they've already made a few copies that it's not a bank, they're not printing, we said the situation, that it's a bank, but we know that they don't want to have a separate page, because they have to enter the bank's app, we tried to use a different color to use the color, it didn't work, so the point is that if you enter a big bank, or a new profile, you have to enter the bank to find it, and then after the onboarding started, and I'm sorry, there was a little error in NFC, what is this, but I was wrong, it wasn't that it didn't know what, it didn't say it was good, it was wrong, so you have to know that this is the iOS dialog, you can't print this, so it will say that it's going to do the X-X, the X-X, but it's going to be a little bit more complicated, so this right, or this left, and this can be done in the first place, when we say that you enter the bank, then you can also add that it doesn't work, so you can download it, which was interesting, this is the image, just the background, which you can see before you enter the content, but now here was the learning, that the video little graphics, so we entered a video that if you have to print, there were too many, you couldn't pay attention, because they tried to read it, to combine it, and to watch the video, it was too much to stimulate them, so we changed a picture, so we said that we used that one combo, which we found in the applications, and there was a sign that this is what it looks like, this is how it works, so after that, we found the buctor, and this is the end, not the end, but the end, so if you don't really like it, and you don't know the version, then you can download it, and it's so interesting to make that you have to have the opportunity to return to the original version, because it looks like you need to find a combo, but that's not the case, the third thing that you have to understand, that there were people who thought that why should I only have the basic application, the user should apply it, and there were people who said that if you try to try it out, then if you like it, then you don't do it, because you don't know how to do it, so this is a lesson, or let's say, a little bit of thought that after the application, you can do it, or you don't have to force it, what was this force? You can do it, or you can use the application, and of course you can do it, but you have to return to a group who don't want to be applied to the application, and they have to be used to be applied, and so it works so that there is no application to be applied, so this is a technique that we use. There was a kind of, after the application and then a shadow came up, or I don't know, a popup, that then it will be applied twice the solution. It was like they didn't understand, because it was like, okay, I try it, but how do I try it? Because it's not worth it, and it didn't mean that it was a little bit annoying, that now what I'm doing, and not because they want me to do what I'm trying to do. So this is a lesson for us, that we have to put in more illustrations, that if you press it twice, then you have to do it 10 times, because then they will understand what's going on. And the last one was I didn't put in the payment twice, because there were many returns, and the last one was okay. And after that the transaction part that we didn't know that we really liked it that they got such a return and we visually started here, but it wasn't very good, we really liked it that it was successful, but it wasn't really a good thing. I'll say that it was the picture was very good that it was a good category, and I really, really, really liked it. Then there was a general preference, that now the graphic is either or you don't need to, or you don't have to or you don't have to see your limits here. In a personal perspective, this is much better to build in, that you can see how much time you have left. Also, the iPhone, the iPhone 2BI, a lot of people already know that you can use the pictures to see how much time the album's distribution is coming, so that it is like this, that people start to see this as an example, or it was the last one, that this is what happens, that this is what I like, that this is what happens. It was a physical development, as if it were a digital development in terms of digitalization, and they saw the cinema city, and they thought that it was a digital and they searched for one, so they wouldn't see it, because there was a half of it in the situation, but at the same time a very valid thought that digitalization is getting obviously a three-mal period, but it was a different thing. Maybe it would be better to have a cinema time or a test-code for example, but it was an interesting experience, and after that we continued to combine the empathy picture and the dystopic and tool things. We saw how much money was in the whole thing, as much as in the bank, which is what we can see. In fact, there were no cash-tip-tips, in the mastercard or in the visa so the mastercard or visa didn't show up in the process, but we thought that this was a function of the bank and that it could be like this, and they thought about it. There was the third person, the third person to finish an interesting digital payment. Because if they see the bank in the process, then it could be that we are taking these people to digital payments. The Web-based payments, the online Web-based payments, are interesting that the banks will not be able to develop their own digital money. Because the banks will not be able to sell all their money. The simple OTP has a solution in this. At the same time, the Kuwaitis can use Kuwaitis or Bitcoin, because now, in the online digital payment projects, if the banks are able to scan the QR code, or if they can use DeepLink, then they can use the U-Talash UI, but as U-Talash is the digital payment, you can do it without U-Talash or U-Talash UI, but with a valid function. If the U-Talash is new, then you need to use the Kuwaitis to scan the QR code. But if they can use the their own U-Talash then they can use it a little better so that the companies have a place to work. They want to be a part of the companies. So, this is a very interesting story that we have with the banks. So, it is a very logical and interesting story to hear from the banks? Yes, yes. So, from this what we have talked about in the project, that basically the Apple wallet or the own wallet is really a challenge and it is a new front in the QuickLson especially in the commerce. So, this is a problem. Yes. Yes, the QR code will be used in the future because I am a quickrame. I have written this in the last ten years because it was an example but it is actually a challenge for me. But I haven't met this before but the Apple has a function to scan the QR code and pay it. I don't know. Yes, this is Sony. Sony? Sony has a kind of development but I think it is PlayStation only. The the Apple has a Chrome version of the Apple PSQL and you can use it to pay it. Yes, you were the pilot of Sony and you were a pilot. Yes, it was already in the three years but it didn't happen and the PS5 is a good home but it is a platform. Yes, I think it was only Sony's collaboration. No. I have ordered a phone call and I paid it. So, I have already seen two places and I don't know where but I can feel it in the market. Yes. And it is the I don't know, the UX. It is not completely the same but it is the scan the QR code and then you can pay it. I can do it. Yes. The difference is that this it is kept in a secure wallet for payment. Yes. What kind of minus are the minuses I have in the first place? The other part is an extra security layer. Yes. Because it doesn't show the payment, but it is a business layer. So, in the end, they will probably eat it like the food. Yes. So, it is a good idea to look at the QR code and the QR code and it is futuristic. I don't know if you have seen it but you can see it. It is good and it is great if you can have a plus function in the new wallet. I don't know yet. I don't know if it is the first or the second, but it is a plus. So, it is good. Well, this is the difficulty. How can I do it without the help of the internet? Now, the quick is that the unifide QR code and the unifide payment are needed to be used in the first place. And it is even more difficult to integrate the QR code of each bank separately to the users. Or, with a quick level unifide payment and there are the truelayer on the Britec which is something like this. It is also connected to the transaction and a bank will be used. But if it is a payment process and it is connected to the transaction with the payment I don't know if you know that. But I saw it, I don't know much about it. And what you said about the unifide payment is a good solution now. iOS is even better because it will be used in the liquid. And the unifide is visible from the camera and it is visible from the bottom. And it is so futuristic and it is not like that. Maybe it is for people. But yes, it is but it is a bit of a problem that the bank will not be able to do it. Do you think it is a problem to call them? No, not at all. I think it is a good solution. Yes, the B which you will get in September. What is the best solution? I am a good person. I am a good person. Digital is not the same. Really? Ok. No, don't use the B, because I am a good person. I don't have to use the B because I can only use the B. Well, this is the topic that you have to talk about or you said something else. You said something else? I will answer the next question but I will answer the next question. Thank you. Thank you. And when we got here this I don't know the draft what topics or how we can react to these I wrote a few words about it. I don't know if I am going to be a coward or if I am going to be a coward or if I am going to be a coward because we will be a coward. But what was important to you the physical functions for example the the the the optimization the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the"
